# 卐卐卐 Nazi Detector 卐卐卐

This Chrome extension derives from the original code of the (((Coincidence Detector))), the odious Chrome extension [used by white supremacists to identify Jews](https://mic.com/articles/145105/coincidence-detector-the-google-extension-white-supremacists-use-to-track-jews#.8erOlWuZ8) by placing a series of parentheses — known as echoes — around their names. This version, instead, identifies Nazis, Klansmen, white supremacists, antisemites, identitarians, racist sh*tposters, ultra-nationalists, homophobes, Islamophobes, neoreactionary sh*tlords, alt-rightists, and other hateful, bigoted a-holes by placing swastikas around 卐卐卐their names卐卐卐. It has barely been changed from its original code.

You can install this extension from [the Google Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nazi-detector/gepjahbfpbjebbdlpmagodedkiodklip).

To check if you were targeted by the (((Coincidence Detector))), see my other project, [The Grand Coincidence](http://progressivejews.org/echoes/).

If you'd like to contribute names to the index, or if you are not a xenophobic ultra-nationalist, white nationalist, white supremacist, antisemite, "anti-Islam" extremist, or other form of racist trash, and you feel you've been unfairly included, please fork and send a pull request, or contact me on Twitter at [@selfagency](https://twitter.com/selfagency). If you are wondering how your account name wound up on this list, it is in all likelihood that you follow and/or amplify prominent white supremacists online.
