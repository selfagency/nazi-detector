# 卐卐卐 Nazi Detector 卐卐卐

This Chrome extension derives from the original code of the (((Coincidence Detector))), the odious Chrome extension [used by white supremacists to identify Jews](https://mic.com/articles/145105/coincidence-detector-the-google-extension-white-supremacists-use-to-track-jews#.8erOlWuZ8) by placing a series of parentheses — known as echoes — around their names. This version, instead, identifies white supremacists by placing swastikas around 卐卐卐their names卐卐卐. It has barely been changed from its original code.

You can install this extension from [the Google Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nazi-detector/gepjahbfpbjebbdlpmagodedkiodklip).

To check if you were targeted by the (((Coincidence Detector))), see my other project, [The Grand Coincidence](http://progressivejews.org/echoes/).

If you'd like to contribute names to the index, or if you are not a xenophobic ultra-nationalist, white nationalist, white supremacist, antisemite, "anti-Islam" extremist, or other form of racist trash, and you feel you've been unfairly included, please fork and send a pull request, or contact me on Twitter at [@selfagency](https://twitter.com/selfagency).

Some Nazi idiots seem to think this is really funny and are proudly announcing their inclusion or seeking inclusion in this list. What they don't yet realize is that the joke is on them. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
